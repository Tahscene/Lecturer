## 🚀 Setup Guide (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — Create your GitHub repo

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → **New Repository**
2. Name it: `bd-lecturer-tracker`
3. Set to **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Click **Create Repository**

### Step 2 — Upload all project files

Upload these files to your repo root:
```
scraper.py
notifier.py
build_dashboard.py
requirements.txt
.github/workflows/scrape.yml
```

You can drag-and-drop files on GitHub's web UI.

### Step 3 — Create a Telegram Bot (takes 2 minutes)

1. Open Telegram → search **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Give it a name (e.g., `BD Lecturer Alerts`)
4. Give it a username (e.g., `bd_lecturer_bot`)
5. BotFather will send you a **token** like:
   ```
   7123456789:AAFxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   Save this — it's your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

6. Now get your Chat ID:
   - Start your bot (send `/start` to it)
   - Open this URL in browser:
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates
     ```
   - Look for `"chat":{"id": 123456789}` — that number is your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

### Step 4 — Add secrets to GitHub

In your repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

Add two secrets:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Your bot token from Step 3 |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your chat ID from Step 3 |

### Step 5 — Enable GitHub Pages

1. Repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: `main` → Folder: `/docs`
4. Click **Save**

Your dashboard will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/bd-lecturer-tracker
```

### Step 6 — Run it for the first time

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repo
2. Click **BD Lecturer Job Tracker** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

It will scrape everything, send Telegram notifications, and deploy your dashboard!
